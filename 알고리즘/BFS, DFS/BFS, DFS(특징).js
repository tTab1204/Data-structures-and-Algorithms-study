// BFS(너비 우선 탐색) - 메모리가 더 많이 듬.
// Shortest Path, Closer Nodes

// DFS(깊이 우선 탐색) - 메모리가 더 적게 듬.

//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare,
// BFS (DFS will take long time. )

//If the tree is very wide: (too many nodes, it's not a binary tree)
// DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
// DFS

//determining whether a path exists between two nodes
// DFS

//Finding the shortest path
// BFS
